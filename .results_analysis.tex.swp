\section{Methods}
% Non adversarial
\subsection{Number available moves}
The simplest of methods available is the number of moves available to the player in the current state.
This is a simple metric and does not capture a complete state of the board, not taking into account the relative state of the opponent.

% area score
\subsection{Area based heuristic}
This is a more complex method, working out the number of empty positions around the current player, the downside of this method is that is is relatively expensive.


% direction of movement
\subsection{Axis of movement based heuristic}
Similar to the number of available moves this method attempts to get more granular detail of the game state by taking into account the directions of movement available to the player. Two methods were implemented for this the first returning the product of the movement along each direction the second from the formula: 

\begin{align}
	\frac{\textrm{num\_axis\_available}}{8} \times \textrm{num\_moves\_available}
	\label{num_moves_available}
\end{align}%


\subsection{Adversarial implementation}
The above heuristics do not take into account adequately the opponent state. When minimax takes this into account this is relatively more expensive as the bulk of computational expense is is in the last layer of the explored space. The solution is to lazily factor in the opponent by applying the same heuristic to the opponent, multiplied by an arbitrary coefficient prioritizing the relevance of the opponent state (or not), as if it were the opponent turn.
